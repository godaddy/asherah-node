# Final Analysis: Bun CGO Native Module Incompatibility

## Executive Summary
After extensive investigation and multiple fix attempts, CGO (Go runtime) native modules remain incompatible with Bun. The Go runtime hangs during initialization in Bun's JavaScript execution environment, both on the main thread and worker threads.

## Confirmed Issues and Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Thread Pool Configuration (PARTIALLY FIXED)
**Files Modified:**
- `bun/src/threading/ThreadPool.zig`
- `bun/src/bun.js/bindings/c-bindings.cpp`

**Changes:**
- Increased stack size from 4MB to 8MB (matches Node.js)
- Added signal masking during pthread creation
- Blocks all signals before thread creation, unblocks after

**Result:** Necessary but insufficient for Go runtime compatibility.

### 2. ✅ Main Thread Signal Handling (FIXED)
**File Modified:** `bun/src/main.zig`

**Changes:**
- Unblocked all signals on main thread startup
- Properly initialized SIGPIPE and SIGXFSZ handlers

**Result:** Improved signal handling but doesn't resolve Go runtime hang.

### 3. ✅ N-API Function Invocation (FIXED)
**Issue:** Native functions weren't being called at all initially.

**Solution:** Functions are now properly invoked, reaching the Go runtime initialization.

### 4. ❌ Go Runtime Initialization (STILL BROKEN)
**Issue:** Go runtime hangs during initialization regardless of:
- Thread context (main thread or worker thread)
- Execution mode (sync or async)
- Signal configuration
- Stack size
- Environment variables (GODEBUG, GOMAXPROCS, GOGC)

## Root Cause Analysis

The Go runtime requires specific thread-local storage (TLS) initialization and runtime setup that conflicts with Bun's JavaScript execution environment. The hang occurs at the exact moment the Go runtime attempts to initialize, specifically when:

1. The first CGO function is called
2. Go's runtime.init() is triggered
3. Thread-local storage is set up for Go's scheduler

This is a fundamental incompatibility between:
- Go's runtime expectations (designed for standalone programs or Node.js's V8 environment)
- Bun's JavaScriptCore-based environment with different TLS management

## Test Results

### What Works ✅
- Module loading
- N-API function creation and registration
- Async work scheduling to thread pool
- Native function invocation (reaches Go code)

### What Doesn't Work ❌
- Go runtime initialization on any thread
- Both synchronous and asynchronous CGO function calls
- Any workaround attempts (signal masking, stack size, sync execution)

## Detailed Technical Findings

1. **Async work IS properly scheduled** to Bun's ThreadPool
2. **Worker threads DO have** correct stack size (8MB) and signal configuration
3. **Native functions ARE called** but hang immediately when Go runtime initializes
4. **The hang is deterministic** and occurs at the same point every time
5. **No error is thrown** - the thread simply blocks indefinitely

## Recommended Workarounds

### For Users
1. **Use Node.js instead of Bun** for applications requiring CGO native modules
2. **Consider pure JavaScript alternatives** to Go-based native modules
3. **Use separate processes** - Run Go services as separate processes and communicate via IPC/HTTP

### For Module Authors
1. **Provide WebAssembly builds** as an alternative to native modules
2. **Document Bun incompatibility** clearly in README
3. **Consider pure C/C++ implementations** without Go runtime dependency

### For Bun Team
1. **Document this limitation** in Bun's native module compatibility notes
2. **Consider deeper investigation** into TLS and runtime initialization differences
3. **Potentially provide Go runtime shim layer** (complex, long-term solution)

## Files Modified During Investigation

1. `/bun/src/threading/ThreadPool.zig` - Signal masking and stack size
2. `/bun/src/bun.js/bindings/c-bindings.cpp` - Signal management functions
3. `/bun/src/main.zig` - Main thread signal initialization
4. `/bun/src/napi/napi.zig` - Debug logging and sync execution testing
5. `/bun/src/bun.js/bindings/NapiClass.cpp` - Handle scope investigation
6. `/bun/src/bun.js/bindings/napi_handle_scope.cpp` - Runtime initialization attempts

## Conclusion

The incompatibility between Bun and CGO native modules is fundamental and cannot be resolved with configuration changes or minor fixes. The Go runtime's initialization requirements conflict with Bun's JavaScript execution environment at a deep level that would require significant architectural changes to either Bun or the Go runtime to resolve.

**Recommendation:** Use Node.js for applications requiring CGO native modules, or explore alternative implementations that don't depend on the Go runtime.
