# Updated CGO Analysis: Stack Size Not Sufficient

## Test Results

### Stack Size Fix Applied
✅ **Change Made**: ThreadPool stack size increased from 4MB to 8MB  
✅ **Build Success**: Bun compiled successfully with the change  
✅ **Module Loading**: CGO module loads without errors in fixed Bun  

### Test Results with Fixed Bun
❌ **Synchronous CGO calls**: Hang (even simple setenv)  
❌ **Asynchronous CGO calls**: Hang  
✅ **Node.js comparison**: Both sync and async work perfectly  

## Key Finding

The **stack size fix alone is not sufficient**. Even synchronous CGO calls hang in Bun, indicating a more fundamental CGO initialization issue.

## Root Cause Update

The issue is not just ThreadPool stack size, but **missing CGO runtime initialization** in Bun's main process. CGO requires:

1. **Main thread initialization**: `x_cgo_init()` must be called on process startup
2. **Per-thread initialization**: `x_cgo_thread_start()` for worker threads  
3. **Runtime notification**: `x_cgo_notify_runtime_init_done()`

### What Node.js Does (Automatically)
- libuv's thread creation happens to satisfy CGO's requirements
- CGO symbols get properly initialized during dlopen
- Main thread and worker threads both work correctly

### What Bun Does (Missing Steps)
- ✅ Module loads (post handle scope fix)
- ❌ CGO runtime never gets properly initialized  
- ❌ Main thread lacks CGO initialization
- ❌ Worker threads lack CGO initialization (even with 8MB stacks)

## The Complete Fix Needed

The stack size fix is **necessary but not sufficient**. Bun needs:

1. **CGO Detection**: During dlopen, detect modules with CGO symbols
2. **Main Thread Init**: Call `x_cgo_init()` when CGO module is loaded
3. **Worker Thread Init**: Call `x_cgo_thread_start()` on each ThreadPool worker  
4. **Stack Size**: Maintain 8MB stacks (already fixed)

## Why Stack Size Alone Doesn't Work

Stack size ensures adequate space for CGO operations, but **CGO won't even attempt operations** without proper thread initialization. The hang occurs because:

1. CGO function is called
2. CGO checks for thread-local runtime state  
3. No state found (never initialized)
4. CGO waits indefinitely for initialization that never comes

## Next Steps

The complete solution requires **both** fixes:
- ✅ Stack size (already implemented)  
- ❌ CGO runtime initialization (still needed)

This explains why our stack size fix didn't resolve the hanging issue.
